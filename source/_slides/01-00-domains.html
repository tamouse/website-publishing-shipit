    <aside class="notes">

        <p>There used to only be a few top-level domains you could
            pick from. Now there are 100s, if not 1000s.</p>

        <p>The most common are still
            <code>.com</code>,
            <code>.org</code>,
            and
            <code>.net</code>,
            and the two-letter country codes.
        </p>

        <p>Popular new ones include
            <code>.info</code>,
            <code>.name</code>,
            <code>.biz</code>,
            and so on.
        </p>

        <h3>Concerns:</h3>

        <p>
            One highly popular TLD presently is
            <code>.io</code>,
            which is the country code assigned to the Indian Ocean
            Territories. This is under the directorate of
            the United Kingdom, and the occupants are primarily
            American U.S. military personnel.
        </p>
        <p>
            The native people of the IO Territories were forceably
            removed from their islands by the British government in
            order to provide the space for the US military.
        </p>
        <p>
            The native people are <strong>still</strong> petitioning
            to be allowed to return to their native land.
        </p>
        <p>
            The native peoples receive absolutely <strong>NO</strong>
            funds from the licensing of the <code>.io</code> top-level
            domain. Think hard about whether it's worth it to you to
            support such an oppressive situation.
        </p>

    <h3 class="blue">"Should I buy privacy services for my
        domain?"</h3>
    <div class="fragment">
        <p>Usually, the answer is "yes".</p>
        <p>It provides real protection from people sniffing around,
            looking to hack your site, or steal your domian.</p>
    </div>

    <aside class="notes">
        <p>Privacy services cloak your personal information that is
            kept in WHOIS databases. This information is required by the
            ICANN in order to regular domains.</p>
        <p>It is, however, publicly available, which means anyone can
            query the WHOIS database and obtain information about you as
            the domain owner. Such information include telephone numbers
            and mailing address.</p>
        <p>The privacy service will cloak this information, giving
            you a chance to determine who can have access to it.</p>

        <h3>Caveats</h3>

        <p>Occasionally, having a privacy service can prevent you
            from moving a domain name from on registrar to another. This
            generally isn't a problem, though, and is something the
            service providers try to prevent.</p>
        <p>Going with a privacy service from one of the big name
            registrars is usually a good thing.</p>
