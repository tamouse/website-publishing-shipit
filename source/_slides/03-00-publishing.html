    <p class="fragment">There are many ways to do this.</p>
    <p class="fragment">In this class, we're going to learn to use
        the File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</p>
    <p class="fragment">We'll be using a tool called "FileZilla" to

    <h3>index.html or index.php</h3>

    <p>
        When the user enters: <br/>
        <code>GDIMinneapolis.com/about/</code>
    </p>

    <p>
        The server looks for and returns <br/>the first one of these it can find:
        <ul>
            <li><code>http://gdiminneapolis.com/about/index.php</code></li>
            <li><code>http://gdiminneapolis.com/about/index.html</code></li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <aside class="notes">
        <p>There are two things happening here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The hostname that the user capitalized is getting
                    shifted to lower case. All domains are lower case.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The server looks the
                    <code>index.php</code>
                    file first, and returns it,
                    else it looks for the
                    <code>index.html</code>
                    file and returns it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In other words, the
                    <code>php</code>
                    file takes precedence over the
                    <code>html</code>
                    file if they both occur in the same directory.

	<h3>Pop quiz</h3>
    <p>
        What file does the server look for when the user enters:
        <code>MyCoolWebsite.com/start</code>?
    </p>
    <p class="fragment blue">http://mycoolwebsite.com/start/index.html</p>

    <h4 class="no-print">{{page.title}}</h4>
    <h3>public_html</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>On the remote server, you will publish  your files to a
            folder called, <code>public_html/</code>.</li>
        <li>This is the default file location for this hosting provider.</li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="notes">
        <p>The <code>public_html</code> folder is the standard folder
            name on many web hosting providers, however, it's not the
            only possibility.</p>
        <p>Make sure to check with your hosting provider to find out
            where you should upload your website files to.</p>
        <p>Quite often, people forget to set the folder they should
            publish to during the transfer. In FileZilla, you can set the
            default folder that is opened with you connect to the
            site. You may want to set it to <code>public_html/</code>
            to avoid such confusion.</p>

	<h3>File Transfer Protocol or FTP</h3>
	<ul>

        <li>We use FTP to transfer files from our local host (our own
            computer) to the remote server, at the hosting provider.</li>

        <li>For this class we will use FileZilla to perform the FTP transfer.</li>

    </ul>

    <aside class="notes">
	    <h3>Alternatives to FileZilla</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Dreamweaver (integrated with the editor)</li>
            <li>CyberDuck on macOS</li>
        </ul>

            The Filezilla UI is fairly easy once you get used to
            it. If you have never done anything like an FTP transfer
            before, though, it can be a little intimidating.
        </p>

        <p>
            The QuickConnect area at the top lets you type straight in
            if you know your web hosting IP address, user name, and
            password.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can also give the ftp address associated with your web
            hosting address, sometimes it's <code>ftp.domainname</code>.

    <aside class="notes">
        <p>When you've connected, you'll need to pay attention to the
            rest of the UI.</p>
        <p>The top panel, under the quick connect bar, shows the
        messages going back and forth between the web server and your
        computer. Pay attention to any error messages that show up
            here.</p>
        <p>The left hand side is for the local machine. Use the upper
        panel to navigate to the folder on your local machine
            containing the source of your web site.</p>
        <p>The right hand side is for the remote machine. Use the
            upper pannel to navigate to the <code>public_html</code>
            folder to receive the source of your web site.</p>
        <p>NOTE: you should be <em>in</em> the folder.</p>.
        <p>Select all the files and folders you want to transfer.</p>
        <p><strong>SPECIAL NOTE:</strong> do NOT select the parent
            folder indicated by the double dots.</p>
        <p>Right-click the selection and choose the "start transfer"
        option. You can also find this in the menu bar at the top of
            the screen or window.</p>
        <p>Watch the lowest pain that shows the transfers
        happening. If there are any errors during the transfer, they
        will show up in the "Failed Transfers" tab.</p>
